## HTML/CSS/Git Intro - Iron News

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills in being a professional web developer is the translation of a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. One of the basic, foundational news portals for professional web developers is "Hacker News," which is kind of like a Reddit for the startup/design/development community with a very... *minimalist* design ethic.

Since it's so simple (there's only one image!).
